Screening Room is experimenting with a UX to browse movies. Task Build an initial prototype of this UI, as a static web application. 

The core of the UI is a giant background video that ﬁlls the window, which changes based on the user pressing the left and right arrow keys. There is a row of thumbnail images on the bottom of the window, indicating the currently selected video. An extended mockup is available in the video ﬁle mockup.mov The application should work in Chrome, with target resolution of 1080p (responsiveness is not necessary, positioning can be absolute). 

Guidelines All necessary media assets are available in the “assets” folder. The ﬁle “data.json” may help map the ﬁle URLs into a Javascript-ready variable. Simply hard-coding the data into a JS variable is sufﬁcient for the scope of this challenge. It is not necessarily to replicate the exact animations and styles of the mockup video. What we’re primarily focused on is the switching of background videos, via arrow keys; the mechanism to indicate/animate the currently active thumbnail is supplementary. Preferably, this app utilizes frontend framework like React, Vue, Angular, etc. Bonus points if the interactions are smooth, with minimum lag.
